Today we are looking at more advanced topics in github
	- Review of pull method
	- Merge conflicts
	- Branches
	- Oh sh*t git

README.md files:
	- Markdown files
	- will be rendered below all of the files in a repository
	- should be description of project
		- installation instructions
		- use cases
		- dependancies
	- Example file in repository

Pull:
	- When you move changes from remote to local you have to pull them
	- Command is 'git pull'
	- You should never have to force pull
	- Pull THEN push, never the other way around. If you do, then it will create a merge conflict

Merge conflicts:
	- Merge conflicts happen when
	- Text is inserted into file where merge conflic exists
		- From head to ====== it tells the user what it looks like on the local commit
		- From ===== to >>>>> it tells the user that it looks like on the remote commit
		- Jumble of numbers is unique hash that refereneces the location in the remote
